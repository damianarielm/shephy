# Shephy

## Description

Shephy is a solitaire card game where you as a shepherd, try to increase your
flock from 1 to 1000 sheep before 1000 "enemy sheep" show up (3 rounds elapse),
or you have 0 sheep. It is fast (15 mins), small (22 cards) and easy to learn.

## Rules

5 of the 22 event cards are drawn to form your hand. The game starts with a
single 1 sheep card in the player's field - the maximum number of cards allowed
in the field at any time is 7. A turn consists of playing an event card,
following the instruction on it, then drawing a new event in its place. The
game ends when the player has gone through the deck 3 times. If they have yet
to upgrade a sheep card to 1000, they lose. If they run out of sheep in their
field they lose also. Many events help you to upgrade or duplicate your sheep,
but many hurt or release part of your flock. Knowing the deck and managing your
hand is the key to victory.
